Malware Data Analysis — README
Overview

This project provides tools, datasets, and workflows for safe, defensive analysis of malware-related data.
The purpose is to support threat intelligence, incident response, security research, and behavioral pattern analysis using non-executing, sanitized, or metadata-only malware information.

⚠️ Important:
This repository does not contain live malware samples, malicious code, or tools for developing malware. All analyses are performed on static metadata, behavioral logs, and public research datasets.

🔐 Safety & Legal Notice

All datasets in this project must be non-executable.

Do not download or run live malware without proper authorization and isolation facilities.

Use a sandbox, VM, or air-gapped system when handling any suspicious files.

This project is solely for education, research, and cyber-defense.

📊 Features
✔ Static Metadata Analysis

Analyze non-executing data such as:

File hashes (MD5/SHA-256)

PE header fields

Import tables

File size and entropy metadata
Only metadata—no raw executable code is distributed.

✔ Behavioral Log Analysis

Use logs generated by secure sandboxes:

File system actions

Network I/O summaries (no raw traffic replay)

Registry modifications

Process tree information

✔ Machine Learning for Detection

Includes safe, high-level workflows:

Feature engineering from metadata/logs

Unsupervised clustering for family grouping

Train/test pipelines for benign vs. malicious classification

✔ Visualization Tools

Heatmaps of API call frequency

Network communication graphs (sanitized)

Temporal behavior timelines

🛠️ Installation
git clone https://github.com/youruser/malware-data-analysis.git
cd malware-data-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage
Run an exploratory analysis notebook
jupyter lab

Preprocess metadata
python src/preprocessing/build_features.py --input data/metadata/ --output features.csv
